# Product-Sales-data-Analysis
Tool used: POWER BI, EXCEL

Hello #datalovers

This is my 3rd Dashboard developed in #powerbi .
It is based on a dataset of Product sales.

üè∑ Link to download the Dataset:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/create-reports/sample-financial-download

üè∑ Objective of the problem :
The main aim of this report is to analyzing sales data allows companies to keep track of their sales 
and answer all critical questions regarding their performance and to show on how we can use the Power BI with 
product sales analysis data by cleaning the data in Power query and use DAX query language and its performance on
presenting the dashboard with different reports to the end users .

we have the data in Excel file .

üè∑ Steps involved in process:
-Download dataset
-Upload data
-Transform data
-Load data
-Create Fact and Dim tables
-Checking Relationships(in Data View)
-Calculating some useful measures
-Designing Visualization
-Publishing it to Power BI service

üè∑DAX queries used in this:
1.To find out the total revenue
Revenue = SUM('fact-financials data'[Revenue generate])

2.To find out the Total sales
Total sale = SUM('fact-financials data'[ Sales])

3.To find out the Total COGS(cost of goods sale) 
Total COGS = SUM('fact-financials data'[COGS])

4.To find out the Gross Profit 
Gross_Profit = 'fact-financials data'[Revenue generate]-'fact-financials data'[COGS]

5.To find out the Gross Profit Percent
Gross Profit % = [Gross Profit]/[Revenue]

6.To know which Top 3 Products are selling as per country
Top 3 products per country = VAR RankingContext= VALUES('dim- Product Detail'[Product]) 
                             RETURN CALCULATE([Total sale],TOPN(3,ALL('dim- Product Detail'[Product]),[Total sale]),RankingContext)
                             
7.To find Total sales by each segment (create measure of sales of each segment)

 ‚Ä¢	Channel Partner
 Channel Partners Total sale = CALCULATE(SUM('fact-financials data'[ Sales]),'fact-financials data'[Segment]="Channel Partners")
 
 ‚Ä¢	Small Business
 Small Business Total sale = CALCULATE(SUM('fact-financials data'[ Sales]),'fact-financials data'[Segment]="Small Business")
 
 ‚Ä¢	Enterprise
 Enterprise Total sale = CALCULATE(SUM('fact-financials data'[ Sales]),'fact-financials data'[Segment]="Enterprise")
 
 ‚Ä¢	Midmarket
 Midmarket Total sale = CALCULATE(SUM('fact-financials data'[ Sales]),'fact-financials data'[Segment]="Midmarket")
 
 ‚Ä¢	Government
 Govt Total sale = CALCULATE(SUM('fact-financials data'[ Sales]),'fact-financials data'[Segment]="Government")
 
üè∑ Learning from the project:
-While working on this project i understand the importance of DAX as we can calculate useful measures from it.
-I learned many new things while creating this dashboard like the creation of page navigation which i used to jump one report to other by a single button click.
-After viewing the complete dashboard i understand how simply we can access the key insights from visualization.

üè∑ Created 4 Reports in This Dashboard:
1. Overview
2. Sales Scorecard
3. Top Products
4. Sales by Segments
